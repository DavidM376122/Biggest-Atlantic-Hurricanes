# 🌪️ Biggest Atlantic Hurricanes Data Analysis

Welcome to the **Biggest Atlantic Hurricanes** data analysis project! In this project, I worked with a dataset that provides details about the most significant hurricanes in the Atlantic, including wind speeds, categories, and other important variables. Using Excel, I performed an in-depth analysis of the dataset to uncover trends and compare wind speeds.

## 📊 Project Overview

This dataset includes records of major hurricanes in the Atlantic, containing critical data such as:

- Hurricane names
- Dates of occurrence
- Wind speeds (mph or km/h)
- Hurricane categories (e.g., Category 1, Category 2, etc.)
- Duration and more

The objective of this analysis was to leverage Excel functions to identify patterns in wind speeds and explore the impact of various factors on hurricane intensity.

## 🛠️ Tools and Techniques Used

### Excel Functions Utilized:
- **`SWITCH`** 🔄: Used to categorize hurricanes based on wind speeds into predefined categories (e.g., Category 1, Category 2, etc.).
- **`COMPARE`** ⚡: Compared wind speeds of different hurricanes to identify the most intense ones.
- **Conditional Formatting** 🎨: Applied formatting rules to easily visualize high-intensity hurricanes.
- **Pivot Tables** 📊: Summarized the dataset to look for trends across different regions and years.
- **Charts and Graphs** 📈: Used line charts and bar charts to visualize hurricane intensity over time.
  
### Data Insights:
- **Wind Speed Comparison** 🌪️: The main focus was to compare wind speeds of the biggest hurricanes.
- **Category Classification** 🏷️: I used the `SWITCH` function to categorize hurricanes based on their wind speeds and show trends over time.
- **Intensity Trends** 📆: Visualized the change in hurricane intensity across different years.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Biggest-Atlantic-Hurricanes.git
    ```

2. Open the `Biggest_Atlantic_Hurricanes.xlsx` file in Excel.

3. Explore the various sheets, pivot tables, and charts to analyze hurricane wind speeds.

4. Use the filters, slicers, and charts to compare different hurricanes and identify trends.

## 📈 Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of Excel in analyzing large datasets, especially in environmental sciences. By leveraging functions like `SWITCH` and using pivot tables, I was able to classify and compare hurricanes based on wind speed, ultimately gaining valuable insights into hurricane intensity and trends.
